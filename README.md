# Stack-Overflow-Search-Engine
It is a necessary for any business to give their user give the relevant results,
so it became a necessary problem to solve for any organization, so we will
be solving this problem using some state of the art machine learning and
software engineering approaches by using the data of the stack overflow to
give relevant search results to the user. One of the major key points which
should be taken into the consideration is the latency requirement for the
above problem, the user will not spend more than half a second to get the
results so the latency requirement for this problem would be less than 0.5 
seconds. So objective of the search engine is to give most relevant
results from the available answered questions to the user using the similarity
based techniques in a computationally optimized manner. So from the design 
stand point we will be building a q/a search engine which on the run time
takes the query question as text and give the most similar answered by using
the text and the semantic similarity of the query as results to the user in less
than 0.5 second.
