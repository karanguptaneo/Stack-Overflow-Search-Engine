(if the reverse list requires some additional (non-standard) implementations, not already declared for the linked list, you might be able to model those in addition.)\n",

      "basically, the arraylist is contiguous where the linkedlist is not.  incrementing to the next location in memory with the arraylist is considered faster than jumping to the next location via a reference in linkedlist.  also, maintenance of the linkedlist would incur overhead to maintain two sets of references for a doubly linked list.\n",
      "\n",
      "subanswer 2 : i haven't looked at these classes in java but typically an array will be faster than a linked list because in a linked list the list is made up of a series of nodes which each of a \"link\" to the next node in the sequence.  so when you ask for the 10th element it has to cycle through 10 elements to pull the one you want.  in an array (unless i'm mistaken) calling for an element takes you straight to that element.\n",
